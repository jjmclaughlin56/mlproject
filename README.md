In the PDF file you will see my projecte complete with graphs and Confusion Matrix to calculate the sample error and estimate the error appropriately with cross-validation.
I imported it as a pdf to make it easier.

I used both a decision Tree and General Booston model to predict the Dataset. I used the Caret Package to do train and test the model then predict. The rest of the comments in the code explains the process that I used. I think these models are good for predicting classes and used them. This shows with the high accuracy %

My Expected Out of sample error rate should be  Accuracy : 0.9966          as Predicted in the Code.
